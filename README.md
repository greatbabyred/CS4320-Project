# Requirements
    - Students work in a team with up to 3 students
    - Each group participates in any one of the Kaggle competitions
    - To increase diversity in the selected competitions, at most, two teams can work in the same competition.
    - You must try several different methods to solve the problem. The methods you choose for the competition do not have to be a model taught in this course.
    - You can choose any proper evaluation metric, but the evaluation metric indicated by the competition must be included.

 
# Milestone and Final Delivery
    - Project information: You will need to have registered for a Kaggle competition.
    - Project checkpoint 1 (15%): For this milestone, you will need to have downloaded the data, and also run some initial pre-processing on it. You should also make at least one dummy submission (all-positive, all-negative, most-frequency) on Kaggle and submit the Jupyter Notebook including the code and a screenshot of the score on Canvas.
    - Project checkpoint 2 (15%): For this milestone, you should do more data preprocessing and have made at least two non-dummy submissions on Kaggle. You should submit an updated Jupyter Notebook.
    - Final report (35%): By this time, you should have made at least six non-dummy submissions on Kaggle. You should submit the Jupyter Notebook as the final report. In the Jupyter notebook, you should clearly explain what experiments (data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning models) you have conducted. Please ensure the final Jupyter Notebook is clean and runable.

 
# Course Project Presentation
We will host the course project presentation sessions (35%) on Nov 19 and Nov 21. The following is a suggested structure for the projection. You don't necessarily have to organize your presentation using these sections in this order, but that would likely be a good starting point for most projects.
    - Overview: Briefly describe the competition your group is tackling. Describe the overall objective.
    - Introduce the dataset and the exploratory data analysis.
    - Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
    - Machine learning models, including the dummy and non-dummy approaches you have tried.
    - Evaluation results.
    - Conclusion and future work
    - How does your team use the LLM in this project?

 
# Grading

Peers will evaluate the presentations. Students will be divided into two groups (A and B) and give presentations on those two classes. Students in Group A/B will grade students in Group B/A. The average value will be the final grade from peers. Details will be provided later.

 
# Key Dates
