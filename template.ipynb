    "A few notes and tips when you work on this project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. The project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n"
